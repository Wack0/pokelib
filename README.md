# Pokelib

Pokelib is a Javascript library based on [Virt.js](https://github.com/arcanis/virt.js/). It allows to abstract the inner architecture of a Pokemon Red rom, and offer an API to fetch and manipulate data structures during the runtime.

**Note** This library is originally a proof of concept. However, it is very usable and pull requests / issues will be looked upon. Please consider updating the README documentation when adding new methods.

## ![](http://www.pokemonelite2000.com/sprites/rbspr/rbspr003.png) Usage

This code assume that you have a Virt.js engine already running.

```js
var pokelib = new Pokelib( engine );

pokelib.on( 'teamslots', function ( e ) {

    var slot = pokelib.teamslots[ e.index ];

    if ( slot.species( ) === null ) {
        console.log( 'There is no more pokemon in the slot #' + e.index );
    } else {
        console.log( 'The pokemon in the slot #' + e.index + ' is at level ' + slot.level( ) );
    }

} );
```

## ![](http://www.pokemonelite2000.com/sprites/rbspr/rbspr006.png) Example

A basic example is shown [here](http://arcanis.github.io/pokelib/example/). It will display your current team and current bag in real time. Pull requests to add new features to this example (such as listing more data, allowing to instantly send pokemon from the PC to the team, ...) are welcomed.
